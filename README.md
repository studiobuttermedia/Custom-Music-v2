# Custom Music Disc v2

This is an old project that I decided to revive again, it's been a while I start revive one of my old projects

**Sample Audio provided is from Kevin MecLeod music which is Copyright free. But it's your own choice to add your own**

You can either add those custom audio before or after Importing the pack. If you wish to change the audio it after importing to your Minecraft worlds. Do the following:

## Adding Audio before importing to Minecraft

It's recommend that you should do this before importing to Minecraft. Download the Repository as a ZIP by [clicking here](https://github.com/studiobuttermedia/Custom-Music-v2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

It's also recommend that you turn on "Show File Extensions" by clicking View in File Explorer, Hover on Show and clicking File Extension

After that Unzip the downloaded ZIP File, open the unzipped folder, go to `sounds/music/game/records`, and add your audio there.

**WARNING**: The Audio files must be an .ogg file and not .mp3, .wav or anything else. Futhermore, the Music files must follow the set of number shown in the folder. Failure to do so will not able you to play any audio and will fall back to In-game Soundtracks.

Once you're done, you can either copy the entire Folder to Minecraft Resource Pack Folder or make it a `.mcpack` file by ZIPing the Folder and rename `.zip` to `.mcpack`

After that, double click on the file to import.

**NOTE**: If you have more than one version of Minecraft and your device doesn't know which one to import, you can fall back to manual import by copying the pack folder that you modify

To do manual import, do the following

### For Windows

- Press `Windows + R`, or open File Explorer and press `F4`.

- Paste this in, it depends on which version you're on

#### Minecraft:

```%localappdata%/Packages/Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe/LocalState/games/com.mojang/resource_packs/```

#### Minecraft Preview:

```%localappdata%/Packages/Microsoft.MinecraftWindowsBeta_8wekyb3d8bbwe/LocalState/games/com.mojang/resource_packs/```

#### Minecraft Education:

**PC Microsoft Store Deploy/Pre-install**

```$localappdata%/Packages/Microsoft.MinecraftEducationEdition_8wekyb3d8bbwe/LocalState/games/com.mojang/resource_packs/```

**PC Desktop**

```%appdata%\Minecraft Education Edition\games\com.mojang\resource_packs```

### For iOS

Open Files, Choose the version you want to import, either Minecraft, Minecraft Preview or Minecraft Education then go to `games/com.mojang/resource_packs/` and import the Folder there.

After importing, if you wish to change the audio, make sure to unload the pack from your Minecraft World, close the game and go to the Resource Pack Folder -> Custom Disc -> `sounds/music/game/records` and change your Audio there.

Future documentation will explain how to create multiple version of the Custom Music Packs to your liking!

Once imported, you can listen to your Custom Discs in Minecraft. Have fun listening to Lo-fi while Mining!
